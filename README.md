# Online Clothing Store

This project is an **Online Clothing Store** built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Firebase**. The application allows users to browse a range of clothing products, add items to their cart, and manage the cart's contents. It features a responsive design that adjusts to various device sizes and allows users to persist their cart items even after refreshing the page by integrating Firebase as a backend database.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Products are displayed with images, names, and prices. Users can search for products based on name or category.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add, remove, and adjust the quantity of items in their shopping cart.
- **Persist Cart Data**: Using Firebase as the database, the cart's data is saved and retrieved, preventing the cart from being emptied when the page is refreshed.
- **Responsive Design**: The website layout is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- **Smooth User Experience**: Interactive features like hover effects, transitions, and button animations provide a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that provides an optimized development environment for React.
- **Firebase**: Used for storing and retrieving cart data, ensuring that the cart persists even after page refreshes.
- **CSS**: For styling the application with responsive layouts and visually appealing design elements.
  
## Firebase Integration

Firebase is used to store the cart data and update it in real-time. When the user adds or removes items from the cart, the data is synchronized with Firebase, ensuring that even if the page is refreshed or reopened, the cart's contents are retained.
